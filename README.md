Project Writeup
Describe two observable trends based on data

1) Charter schools outperform District schools significantly on average scores and percentage of students passing. 
This is most observable when you compare the % of overall passing (% of students passing both math and reading), 
where charter schools have a 90% overall passing rate and district schools have a 53% overall passing rate.

2) Per student budget has an effect on average scores, but not in the way one might assume. Schools who spend less per 
student actually have better scores than schools who spend the most per student. Based on this data set, if you wanted to maximize your changes of attending a school with high scoring students, you would want to attend a small charter scool with a per student budget of $584 or less.
